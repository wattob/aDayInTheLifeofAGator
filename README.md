A Java program that takes the user through decisions throughout Allegheny. Eventually, the program will lead you to a Greek Fight, which is a turn based battle also using the users decisions.

## About This Project
This Java project was created by 2 Allegheny College students for a final project for the Fall 2017 semester (in CMPSC111). As such there are some files relating to the assignment, such as the files located in the writing file and some files say "lab" in them. Since this project was submitted in December, it will most likely not be updated. All of the files commits were copied over from the original GitHub classroom repository.

## Running The Project
This project uses gradle. Here are some important commands that can be used in terminal to use the project:
* `gradle build`: create the bytecode from the Java source code
* `gradle run`: run the Java program in the command-line

You can also complete several important Java programming tasks by using the
`gradle` tool. For instance, you can compile (i.e., create bytecode from the
program's source code if it is a correct program) the program using the command
`gradle build`. There are also additional commands that you can type:

* `gradle clean`: clean the project of all the derived files
* `gradle check`: check the quality of the code using Checkstyle
* `gradle tasks`: display details about the Gradle system

## Travis

This assignment uses [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/) to automatically run
a checking program every time you commit to your GitHub repository. The
checking will start as soon as you have accepted the assignment, thus creating
your own private repository, and the course instructor enables Travis for it. If
you are using Travis for the first time, you will need to authorize Travis CI to
access the private repositories that you created on GitHub.

## Requirements

The GatorGrader software that supports the checking of this assignment was
developed for the following software and versions:

* gradle 4.1
* java 1.8.0
* mdl 0.4.0
* proselint 0.7.0

## Problems

If you have found a problem with this assignment's provided source code, then
you can go to the [Computer Science 111 Lab 11
Starter](https://github.com/Allegheny-Computer-Science-111-F2017/cs111-F2017-lab11-starter)
repository and create an issue by clicking the "Issues" tab and then clicking
the green "New Issue" button. If you have found a problem with the [GatorGrader
tool](https://github.com/gkapfham/gatorgrader) and the way that it checks you
assignment, then you can follow the aforementioned steps to create an issue in
its repository. To ensure that your issue is properly resolved, please provide
as many details as is possible about the problem that you experienced. If you
discover a problem with the laboratory assignment sheet, then please raise an
issue in the
[cs111-F2017-lab-sheets](https://github.com/Allegheny-Computer-Science-111-F2017/cs111-F2017-lab-sheets)
repository and mention this assignment.

Students who find, and use the appropriate GitHub issue tracker to correctly
document, a mistake in any aspect of this laboratory assignment will receive
free laptop stickers and extra credit towards their grade for it.

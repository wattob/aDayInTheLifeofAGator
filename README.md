# aDayInTheLifeofAGator
For this Java program, we created a text based adventure game that took the user
through a series of decisions that they needed to make in order to make it through
a day as an Allegheny student. For the design, we focused on using conditional logic for the different different decision throughout the day.

## About This Project
This Java project was created as a Final Project at Allegheny College for CMPSC111. Many of the files used by this include a description from the lab. This program will most likely not be updated again and the commits have been copied over from the original repository.

## Running The Project
You can also complete several important Java programming tasks by using the
`gradle` tool. For instance, you can compile (i.e., create bytecode from the
program's source code if it is a correct program) the program using the command
`gradle build`. There are also additional commands that you can type:

* `gradle build`: create the bytecode from the Java source code
* `gradle run`: run the Java program in the command-line
* `gradle clean`: clean the project of all the derived files
* `gradle check`: check the quality of the code using Checkstyle
* `gradle tasks`: display details about the Gradle system

## Travis

This assignment uses [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/) to automatically run
a checking program every time you commit to your GitHub repository. The
checking will start as soon as you have accepted the assignment, thus creating
your own private repository, and the course instructor enables Travis for it. If
you are using Travis for the first time, you will need to authorize Travis CI to
access the private repositories that you created on GitHub.

## Requirements

The GatorGrader software that supports the checking of this assignment was
developed for the following software and versions:

* gradle 4.1
* java 1.8.0
* mdl 0.4.0
* proselint 0.7.0
